# Pricing Examples and Common Pitfalls

## Examples

### Example 1: Price Increase (Good Case)

**Scenario:** 20% price increase for new customers only

**Current state:**
- ARPU: $100/month
- Customers: 1,000
- MRR: $100K
- Churn: 3%/month
- New customers/month: 50

**Proposed change:**
- New customer pricing: $120/month (+20%)
- Existing customers: Grandfathered at $100

**Impact:**
- New customer ARPU: $120 (+20%)
- Churn risk: Low (existing protected)
- Conversion impact: Minimal (<5% drop estimated)

**Recommendation:** Implement. Net revenue impact +$12K/year with low risk.

### Example 2: Price Increase (Risky)

**Scenario:** 30% price increase for all customers

**Current state:**
- ARPU: $50/month
- Customers: 5,000
- MRR: $250K
- Churn: 5%/month (already high)

**Proposed change:**
- All customers: $65/month (+30%)

**Impact:**
- ARPU lift: +30% = +$75K MRR
- Churn risk: High (5% to 8% estimated)
- Churn-driven loss: 3% x 5,000 x $65 = -$9.75K MRR/month

**Net impact:** +$75K - $9.75K = +$65K MRR (but accelerating churn problem)

**Recommendation:** Don't change. Fix retention first (reduce 5% churn), then raise prices.

### Example 3: New Premium Tier

**Scenario:** Add $500/month premium tier

**Current state:**
- Top tier: $200/month (500 customers)
- ARPA: $200

**Proposed change:**
- New tier: $500/month with advanced features
- Expected adoption: 10% of current top tier (50 customers)

**Impact:**
- Upsell revenue: 50 x ($500 - $200) = +$15K MRR
- Cannibalization risk: Low (features justify premium)
- NRR impact: Increases from 105% to 110%

**Recommendation:** Implement. Creates expansion path, minimal cannibalization risk.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Ignoring Churn Impact
**Symptom:** "We'll raise prices 30% and make $X more!" (no churn modeling)

**Consequence:** Churn wipes out revenue gains. Net impact negative.

**Fix:** Model churn scenarios (conservative, base, optimistic). Factor churn-driven revenue loss into net impact.

---

### Pitfall 2: Not Grandfathering Existing Customers
**Symptom:** "We're raising prices for everyone effective immediately"

**Consequence:** Massive churn spike from existing customers who feel betrayed.

**Fix:** Grandfather existing customers. Raise prices for new customers only.

---

### Pitfall 3: Testing Without Statistical Power
**Symptom:** "We tested on 10 customers and it worked!"

**Consequence:** 10 customers isn't statistically significant. Results are noise.

**Fix:** Test with large enough sample (100+ customers per cohort) for 60-90 days.

---

### Pitfall 4: Pricing Changes Without Value Justification
**Symptom:** "We're raising prices because we need more revenue"

**Consequence:** Customers see price increase without corresponding value increase. Churn.

**Fix:** Tie price increases to value improvements (new features, better support, outcomes delivered).

---

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring CAC Payback Impact
**Symptom:** "Higher ARPU is always better!"

**Consequence:** If conversion drops 30%, effective CAC increases dramatically. Payback period explodes.

**Fix:** Calculate CAC payback impact. Higher ARPU with lower conversion might make payback worse, not better.

---

### Pitfall 6: Annual Discounts That Hurt Margin
**Symptom:** "30% discount for annual prepay!" (improves cash but destroys LTV)

**Consequence:** Customers lock in low prices for a year. Revenue per customer decreases.

**Fix:** Limit annual discounts to 10-15%. Balance cash flow improvement with LTV protection.

---

### Pitfall 7: Copycat Pricing (Competitor-Based)
**Symptom:** "Competitor raised prices, so should we"

**Consequence:** Your customers, value prop, and cost structure are different. What works for them may not work for you.

**Fix:** Use competitors as data points, not decisions. Make pricing decisions based on your unit economics.

---

### Pitfall 8: Premature Optimization
**Symptom:** "Let's A/B test 47 different price points!"

**Consequence:** Analysis paralysis. Spending months on 5% pricing optimizations while missing 50% growth opportunities elsewhere.

**Fix:** Big pricing changes (tiers, packaging, add-ons) matter more than micro-optimizations. Start there.

---

### Pitfall 9: Forgetting Expansion Revenue
**Symptom:** "We're maximizing ARPU at acquisition"

**Consequence:** High upfront pricing prevents landing customers. Miss expansion opportunities.

**Fix:** Consider "land and expand" strategy. Lower entry price, higher expansion revenue via upsells.

---

### Pitfall 10: No Pricing Change Communication Plan
**Symptom:** "We're raising prices next month" (no customer communication)

**Consequence:** Surprised customers churn. Poor reviews. Reputation damage.

**Fix:** Communicate pricing changes 30-60 days in advance. Emphasize value, not just price.
