## What

<one or two sentences: what changes for the user or the system>

Fixes <LINEAR-ID>

## Which requirements this satisfies

> One row per requirement from `changes/<id>/facts.md`, or from the issue when there is no change
> folder. A requirement with no proof is not done, and a proof with no requirement is scope creep.

| Requirement | Proof |
|---|---|
| F1 | `<test file> › <test name>` |
| F2 | manual: <who checked, and how> |

## Verification

- [ ] `<verify command>` exits 0
- [ ] Every `F`/`N` above has a proof in the table
- [ ] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker is left in the change folder or the issue

## Out of scope

- <what this PR deliberately does not do>

<!--
Decision4 writing rules:
- Use the exact heading below and one coloured circle only, beside the selected class: 🟢 Undo, 🟡 Repair, 🟠 Migrate or 🔴 Answer.
- The sentence after the class explains why this class applies with concrete recovery requirements; do not write "contained fix-up".
- List Recovery steps in order, numbered when there is more than one. For Undo the sentence may suffice and Recovery steps may be omitted.
- Do not repeat the sentence in the steps or invent steps to fit a class.
- Include Work preserved only when this PR really keeps something recoverable; claim backups only when the PR supports them.
- Responsible for recovery is a role; Answer requires a named person.
- Choose one class per PR, the highest that applies; split a PR whose parts need very different classes.
- Classification change is None unless the class changes; then record from -> to, by whom and why.
